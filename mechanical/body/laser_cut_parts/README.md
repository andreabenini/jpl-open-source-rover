Contains the files required to cut the body plates.

> **Note**: The side plates and 'gap slats' are identical and so only one file is included. Make sure you include **two side plates and two gap slats** when you get it laser cut!

## Optional: Engrave the mission patch

Front plates with the Rover patch logo as an engraving have been included as PDF files. There are two versions. The 'Opaque' version requires that the logo be engraved on the top surface of the material. The 'Clear' version allows the engraving to be on the bottom side so the top surface is smooth. 

## Changelog

* Use 22mm standoffs.
* All holes have been made slightly larger to better accomodate the M3 screws. The size of the switch hole on the rear plate is also slightly larger. 
* Some of the holes on the side and bottom plates have been moved to simplify assembly.

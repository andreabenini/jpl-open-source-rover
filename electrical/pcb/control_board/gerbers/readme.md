# Board files (v2.0.3)

`Control_Boards.kicad_pcb` in the project root holds **both** boards in a single
design. The files here are single-board copies of it:

- `brain_board.kicad_pcb` — 52 footprints
- `motor_board.kicad_pcb` — 96 footprints

They are generated, not hand-edited, and are **not tracked in git** -- they are
byte-reproducible from `Control_Boards.kicad_pcb` as of the `v2.0.3` tag, so only
the fabrication gerbers under `gerber_files/` are committed. Regenerate them after
a fresh clone, or after any change to the combined board:

```sh
python3 ../documentation/utilities/split_boards.py \
    ../Control_Boards.kicad_pcb --outdir . --write
```

The splitter partitions the design along Y: the two board outlines are separated
by a 51 mm empty band (motor board spans y = -78..100, brain board y = -229..-129),
so a horizontal cut at y = -100 divides it cleanly. Run without `--write` first to
see the item counts and the reference designators that land on each side.

### 3D model paths

KiCad resolves relative `(model ...)` paths against `${KIPRJMOD}`, which is the
directory holding the board file. Moving a board down into `gerbers/`
therefore breaks every `./3d_models/...` reference in it -- silently, with no error.
That is why the committed v2.0.1 and v2.0.2 split boards rendered with bare footprints
(see git history)
where the Roboclaws, regulators, PCA9685 and XT30 connectors should be: all 28 of
the motor board's project-local models and all 11 of the brain board's fail to load.

`split_boards.py` rewrites those paths to `${KIPRJMOD}/../3d_models/...` as it
writes, corrects filename case so they also resolve on case-sensitive filesystems,
and repairs the stray `../3d_models/277-14404-ND.step` on J16/J17/J18 that is broken
in the combined board itself. All 39 project-local models resolve in these files.

These files are what the 3D documentation images are rendered from and what the
fabrication gerbers are plotted from — see
`../documentation/utilities/render_3d.sh` and
`../documentation/utilities/export_gerbers.sh`.

They also carry the **expanded** version string: the combined board holds
`${VERSION}` on the silkscreen, and the splitter substitutes the project text
variable as it writes, so what gets etched is a literal. Re-split after every
change to the combined board.

The fabrication gerbers and per-board zips are in `gerber_files/`, and
`parts_list/extra_parts.md` points builders there.

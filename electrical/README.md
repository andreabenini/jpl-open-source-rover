## Ordering PCBs

To order these boards we suggest that you order from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), this PCB fabrication company is quite inexpensive for this board size and has good turnaround time. Upload the .zip files individually and make sure the following settings are set:

* Layers - 2
* Dimension - 53 x 69 mm (arduino shield) & 175 x 154 mm (roboclaw breakout)
* PCB Qty - 10
* PCB Thickness - 1.6 mm
* PCB Color - Whatever color you want
* Surface Finish - HASL
* Copper Weight - 1oz
* Gold Fingers - No
* Panel by JLPCB - No
* Flying Probe Test - Fully Tested
* Castellated Holes - No
* Different Design - 1

## Creating the wiring

This is a soft prerequisite for assembling some of the mechanical assemblies. If you have wiring ready, you will be able to route the wires through the rover once and for all.

## Soldering the PCBs

Follow the instructions at [electrical build](electrical_build.md)
